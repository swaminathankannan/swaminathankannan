⚡ **Fun Fact:**  
- The very first computer virus, called **"Creeper"**, wasn’t malicious—it was more like a prank! It displayed the message:  
  *“I’m the Creeper, catch me if you can!”*  
  It was followed by the first antivirus, **"Reaper,"** which was designed to remove Creeper. So technically, the first virus and antivirus were part of the same story! 😄
